# Project Tiramisu

- Our generation (which is a bit lousy, but I digest) deserves a better dating app


### Should we do it? 

1. Is there something else like this?
- Couldn't find beyond first page of google search (yawn...)

2. Why haven't others done it

> RP: "PEOPLE ARE SMART"

- Perhaps some legal issues?
- Moral issues? 

> HO: "PEOPLE AREN'T SMART"

Either:
- A creative technologist didn't go on a date bad enough to have thought about it

Or:
- Average "John" can't code his/her ass out
[There is a girl named "John" and her story is HILARIOUS (check it out)](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8206376/woman-john-name-change-girlier-teased/)

--------

HO: Proposed theme 

1. Open source project 
2. To be done only in free time
3. Just have fun
